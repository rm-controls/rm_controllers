# rm_shooter_controller

## Overview
The rm_shooter_controller has four states: STOP, READY, PUSH, and BLOCK, it controls the left and right friction wheels and the trigger wheel through PID algorithm according to the command. It can set the bullet speed by setting the angular velocity of the friction wheel, and at the same time realizes the block detection.

The rm_shooter_controller package has been tested under [ROS](http://www.ros.org) Melodic and Noetic on respectively 18.04 and 20.04. This is research code, expect that it changes often and any fitness for a particular purpose is disclaimed.

### Hardware interface type

+ `JointStateInterface` Used to obtain the speed of friction wheel and trigger wheel and the position of trigger wheel .
+ `EffortJointInterface` Used to send torque commands for friction wheels and trigger wheel .

## Installation

### Installation from Packages

To install all packages from this repository as Debian packages use

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-rm-shooter-controllers
```
or better use `rosdep`:
```

#### Building

To build this package with catkin build. Clone the latest version from this repository into your catkin workspace.
```
catkin_workspace/src
git clone https://github.com/rm-controls/rm_controllers.git
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src
catkin build
```

## Usage

Run the controller with mon launch:

```
mon launch rm_shooter_controllers load_controllers.launch
```

## Cfg

+ **shooter.cfg:** Add parameters related to friction wheel speed corresponding to each bullet speed and trigger block detection parameters

## Launch files

- **load_controller.launch:** Load the parameters in config files and load the shooter controller.

## ROS API

#### Subscribed Topics

* **`command`** (rm_msgs/ShootCmd)

  Commands of controller state, bullet speed, frequency of shooting .

#### Parameters

* **`block_effort`, `block_speed`, `block_duration`** (`double`)

  When the torque of the plucking motor is greater than `block_effort` (in NÂ·m), and the angular velocity is less than `block_speed` (in rad/s), it will be regarded as jamming if it continues for `block_duration` (in s) .

* **`block_overtime`** (`double`)

  If the time to enter block state exceeds `block_overtime` (in s), it will be judged as timeout and exit block state .

* **`anti_block_angle`** (`double`)

  If enter block state, the friction wheel will reverse `anti_block_angle` (in rad) to try to get rid of the structing .

* **`anti_block_threshold`** (`double`)

  If the anti angle of the friction wheel exceeds `anti_block_threshold` (in rad), it means that trigger reverse success .

* **`qd_10`, `qd_15`, `qd_18`, `qd_30`** (`double`)

  It means friction wheel's angular velocity, the number of it's name expresses different bullet speeds (in m/s) .
